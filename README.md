# Library-Management-System

The Library Management System is a Python-based project designed to simplify the tasks of librarians by providing an efficient platform to maintain an online database of library activities. This system streamlines the process of tracking books issued and returned, identifying students who haven't returned books on time, and recognizing frequent borrowers. By automating these tasks, the Library Management System reduces the manual workload on librarians, enhances the accuracy of record-keeping, and improves the overall management of library resources, ultimately contributing to a more organized and efficient library environment.
